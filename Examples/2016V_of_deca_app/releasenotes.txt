NOTES:  

1) If antenna delay is too large the resulting RTD measurements are negative
   (internally) and discarded as bad.  So, if it seems as if Time of Flight
   is not working, first clear antenna delays to see if that is the issue.

Source Release Version 3.03  ( 11th September 2015 )
=============================================================================

It is updated with the following changes (w.r.t. release 3.02):

a) Changed computation of response delays to be consistent with response
delays definition in Decawave's documents.

b) change version string to 3.03.

NOTE: This version is not compatible with previous ones! 

=============================================================================
Source Release Version 3.02  ( 28th August 2015 )

Source Release Version 3.01  ( 17th August 2015 )
=============================================================================

It is updated with the following changes (w.r.t. release 3.00):

a) make the anchor define tag's reponse delay (between anchor's response and
final transmission) by adding an extra field in ranging init message and
recomputing internal timings upon reception of it.

b) fix the computation of delay between blink transmission and range init
reception.

c) fix the computation of delay between poll transmission and final
transmission.

d) reduce margin on frame timeouts.

e) fix smart power activation condition.

f) formatting refactoring (indent, constant names, variable names, etc.)

g) change version string to 3.01

NOTE: This version is not compatible with previous ones!
